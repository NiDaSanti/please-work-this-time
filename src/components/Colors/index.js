// get three colors (gold, navy, white)
// font colors maybe black
// from 6AM TO 9AM colors can be a skyblue and fontcolor should be navy and dark grey
// 9AM morning colors
// maybe they should be brighter colors
// gradient colors
// three diffrent colors for different conditions
// put colors in an array maybe and pick them out by index number
// create conditional statements that ties with momment.js
// i cant think of anything else at this at this time.
// i would need to figure out if im going to use a class component or functional component.
